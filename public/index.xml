      <description>Chipotle Social Media Site As I mentioned at the tail end of yesterdays blog, today was mainly to start work on moving the data to a database and figure out the API stuff&#xA;However, when I started working today I found that I could just use Node.js to create the API server, and use a library to port the csv into json that could be used by the Javascript in index.</description>

      <description>Chipotle Social Media Site Did some preliminary research yesterday and found that something very similar to what I want to do has already been done. The site has a map as the default background with pins for locations of Chipotle&amp;rsquo;s that you can click and see the rating and other information for.&#xA;I would like to do something similar to this, but instead of just ratings and a few comments, I want to have a live feed, similar to Instagram, where you can see pictures and ratings of food that was just prepared at the location!</description>
