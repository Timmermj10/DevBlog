<p>As I mentioned at the tail end of yesterdays blog, today was mainly to start work on moving the data to a database and figure out the API stuff</p>
<p>However, when I started working today I found that I could just use Node.js to create the API server, and use a library to port the csv into json that could be used by the Javascript in index.html</p>
<p>This saved me a lot of pain, I will still need to eventually set up a database to store user data and reviews, among other things, but I actually got to work on the looks of the site today!</p>
<p>I got the API server set up quite fast with the help of GitHub Copilot and was able to get all of the locations shown on the map</p>
<p><img src="../../images/chipotle_locations_on_map.png" alt="First look at all the Chipotle locations on the map"></p>
<p>This was quite laggy, since each of the 3397 locations were being shown at once</p>
<p>Luckily Leaflet has already thought of this and has a grouping protocol that I could use!</p>
<p>I coded all of that up and then decided I wanted to take a stab at creating cooler icons for the Chipotles, I decided on a circle with a burrito icon in the middle that when zoomed in enough turns into a square with details about the Chipotle</p>
<p>I also made some minor changes to the zooming of the map as well as when tooltips would show up and where.</p>
<p>All in all a very productive and exciting day! I will be spending the rest of the night trying to clean the data a bit more for the information boxes on the web app.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I hope to tackle what happens when a user clicks on an individual Chipotle location, what they see, how they can interact, what information is most important to the user, etc!</p>
<p>How the site looks at the end of day 2!
