<p>Did some preliminary research yesterday and found that something very similar to what I want to do has already been done. The site has a map as the default background with pins for locations of Chipotle&rsquo;s that you can click and see the rating and other information for.</p>
<p>I would like to do something similar to this, but instead of just ratings and a few comments, I want to have a live feed, similar to Instagram, where you can see pictures and ratings of food that was just prepared at the location!</p>
<p>This will allow people to get a really good feel for if their cravings are going to be satisfied with the portion, or if they should just wait for another day.</p>
<p>Today, I will be working on gathering the data for the locations of all the Chipotle&rsquo;s in the US. I found a website that sells this data, but the price is <strong>$95!</strong> Absolutely not, if you are curious <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Chipotle-USA/">this</a> is the site that I found selling the data.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to build a web scraper today that will gather the location data from Chipotle&rsquo;s location <a href="https://locations.chipotle.com/">page</a>, and store it into a database.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-day-update">End of day update:</h2>
<p>I was able to get a scraper working in about 3 hours</p>
<p>I started the big run of the program before heading to the gym</p>
<p>The program failed because there wasn&rsquo;t a phone number on one of the locations</p>
<p>I fixed this by throwing some try except statements in the location where we search for those elements</p>
<p>I ran it again and got my first full set of <a href="https://github.com/Timmermj10/ChipotleRater/blob/main/WebscrapLocationData/chipotle_locations_v1.csv">data</a></p>
<p>I then made some adjustments to the process to make it run slightly faster and added some more data fields to gather to make the <a href="https://github.com/Timmermj10/ChipotleRater/blob/main/WebscrapLocationData/chipotle_locations_v2.csv">dataset</a> more complete</p>
<p>I now have a full dataset similar to <a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Chipotle-USA/">ScrapeHero</a>, I plan to post the dataset on Kaggle to support other people looking for the data without having to pay the steep $95 price tag</p>
<p>I hope to start moving this data to a database tomorrow as well as some API work tomorrow!</p>
<p>Loooonnngggg coding day today! But I learned a lot about Beautiful Soup and it&rsquo;s capabilities!</p>
