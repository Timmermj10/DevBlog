<p>Tough tough day today. I started the day by formatting the basic layout of the modal for the review page. This included sections for ratings 0-5 stars on food quality, quantity, staff quality, additional notes, and time taken to recieve food. This part went quite well and I was able to get example submissions working as well as resetting the values of the submission after closing/submitting a forum.</p>
<p>I then moved into trying to setup a database so I could start sending the ratings to be posted and seen through an Instagram like feed. I wanted to learn a new DBMS instead of using SQLite, so I decided on PostgreSQL. This is one of the most popular DBMS currently and it is fully open source, with many startups using it as their main data storage system.</p>
<p>This is where this started to go awry, I had no problem downloading the software and getting all the files into their correct places, but when I went to actually start using the software it told me that I had input the wrong password. I tried resetting it multiple times and no matter what everytime it denied me access. This went on for an hour or so and I got so angry that I just went on a walk to clear my head.</p>
<p>By the time I got back I had no interest in trying anything else for the rest of the night and decided to log off. So I&rsquo;m sure my future self will have a really fun time trying to figure that out tomorrow!!!</p>
<p>Anyways, here is a picture of the forum</p>
