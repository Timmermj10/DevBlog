## [DevBlog for Jacob Timmerman](https://timmermj10.github.io/DevBlog/)

Will use this as a form of keeping up to date with different projects that I will be working on. 

The blog will mainly consist of different coding updates on what I have been working on/learning, but will also have the occasional lifestyle post.

It will also serve as a reminder to me of how far I have come as the blog progresses. Being able to look back on old things I have done has become something I really like to do, so having a place for all things coding will be nice for future me!

Enjoy :)
